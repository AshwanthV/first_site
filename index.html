                Giza is located on the western bank of the Nile River, and it is a historically and culturally significant city in Egypt. It is home to the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx, which are ancient wonders of the world. These monuments also raise many questions about how advanced the ancient Egyptians truly were. Giza has recently become a bustling city full of tourists and adventurers seeking to see the ancient lure of Egypt.  
                Giza is a city that is very unique for a lot of reasons.
